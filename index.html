            <p>I am a former news and sports writer for the ABC News affiliate in Dallas, Texas. I decided to leave
                the job after several years because it was awful writing about crimes. I've always been interested in
                web
                development because it is a business that can give me greater control. I finished my Bachelor of Science
                degree in Nutrition at Arizona State University and have decided to move to West Palm Beach,Florida.
                Who knows, perhaps I'll find work as a web developer at a health or nutrition company. Below are just a
                few of the things I love.</p>
